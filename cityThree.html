                Established in 1718, New Orleans has always had a rich history. 
                Discovered and named by french explorers, NOLA has attracted those far and wide due to its creativity, southern hospitality, and nack for charm.
                New Orleans is the birth place of jazz, arising from African Americans who were influenced by French and Spanish culture, that merged perfectly with their African heritage.
