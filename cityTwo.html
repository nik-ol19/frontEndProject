            Natchitoches was established in 1714, by a French Canadian explorer. The Red River runs right through the city and it is now known as the Cane River.
            The city served as a trading post for the Indian and Spanish territories. Today there are still bits of history all over the city! 
            Lest I not forget about the French Market. Stop in for a sweet yam loaf. We cant wait to meet you!
